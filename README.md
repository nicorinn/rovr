# ROVR

Hello! This is my project for the Shopify Frontend Development Intern Challenge. As listed in the technical requirements, this site retrieves images from one of NASA's APIs. I chose the Curiosity Rover's image list.

The site displays the day's images, along with maps that show the location where they were taken.

## Technologies used

- React
- Typescript
- ChakraUI component library
- Redux Toolkit (only to show that I know how to use it, since it's a pretty small project)
- [NASA-AMMOS/MMGIS](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/MMGIS) for the map

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
