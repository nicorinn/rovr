# ROVR

Hello! This site retrieves images from the NASA the Curiosity Rover's image list [https://github.com/chrisccerami/mars-photo-api](API). For now, only the images from the latest day are displayed.

The site displays the day's images, along with a map that show the location where they were taken.

### Next steps

- [ ] Add a new page in which the date can be selected
- [ ] Remove images that are too similar

## Technologies used

- React
- Typescript
- ChakraUI component library
- Redux Toolkit (only to show that I know how to use it, since it's a pretty small project)
- [React Leaflet](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet)
- [NASA-AMMOS/MMGIS](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/MMGIS) for the map tiles and waypoints
